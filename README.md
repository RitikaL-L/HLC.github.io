### Hello, I'm Ritika Loni 👋

I am passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world problems and making an impact through creative solutions. 
Here's a glimpse into my journey:  


## 🛠 Projects

### *Homelessness and Living Conditions*  

*OVERVIEW:*  

Overcrowding:
Overcrowding happens when too many people live in a limited space, often due to housing shortages and poverty. It leads to health risks, stress, reduced privacy, and strain on public services like water, electricity, and transportation.

Inadequate Infrastructure:
Poor infrastructure, such as lack of clean water, sanitation, transportation, and energy, limits access to essential services. This hampers economic growth, exacerbates inequality, and contributes to health and safety issues.

Housing Crisis:
A housing crisis arises when affordable housing is scarce due to rising property costs, stagnant wages, and insufficient government policies. It results in homelessness, overcrowding, and financial strain for households.

Environmental Issues:
Urbanization and poor planning lead to pollution, waste mismanagement, deforestation, and climate change. These environmental challenges worsen living conditions and increase the vulnerability of housing to natural disasters.
*Technical Stack:*  

- *Languages:* C++.
- *Algorithms:* Dijkstra’s,Graph Traversal (DFS/BFS), Max Flow algorithm, Greedy Algorithm, Dynamic programming.
- *Tools:* Graphs, DAA Optimization Techniques  

*Impact:*  

-*Overcrowding
Health Risks: Increased spread of communicable diseases due to close proximity and poor sanitation.
Mental Stress: Lack of privacy and personal space causes anxiety and tension.
Educational Barriers: Children lack quiet spaces for study, impacting academic performance.
Infrastructure Strain: Overburdened utilities (water, electricity) and public services (transportation, healthcare).

-*Inadequate Infrastructure
Health Issues: Poor sanitation and lack of clean water lead to disease outbreaks.
Economic Inefficiency: Delayed transport, power outages, and limited connectivity reduce productivity.
Social Inequality: Unequal access to infrastructure deepens the wealth gap.
Environmental Degradation: Poor waste management causes pollution and health hazards.

-*Housing Crisis
Homelessness: Increased numbers of people without stable or adequate shelter.
Overcrowding: Families forced to live in cramped and unsafe conditions.
Financial Strain: High housing costs reduce disposable income for essentials.
Social Instability: Housing insecurity fosters anxiety, poor mental health, and community displacement.

-*Environmental Issues
Health Hazards: Pollution causes respiratory illnesses and other health problems.
Climate Displacement: Rising sea levels, droughts, and extreme weather displace communities.
Ecosystem Damage: Loss of biodiversity due to urban sprawl and deforestation.
Infrastructure Stress: Extreme weather events damage roads, bridges, and housing, increasing costs.
